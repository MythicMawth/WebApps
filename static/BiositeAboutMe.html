	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src = "\static\Images\DoubleGlasses.jpeg" alt = "This is an image of Daniel Nkunga with is mother"  height="500" class = "center">
	<h2>Origins</h2>
	<img src = "\static\Images\Baby.jpeg" alt = "This is a picture of Daniel on his first day of Senior Year"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>Daniel was born in Columbus, Georgia in 2006. He only lived there for a year though before moving to Houston, Texas. He lived in the Lone Star State until 
		he was nine when he then moved to Arkansas. He was devastated by that move then and still thinks about that move now. In Arkansas, he began attending private 
		schools. First he attended Immaculate Conception in North Little Rock for the rest of elementary and middle school and Catholic High School for Boys for the 
		first two years of high school.</p>

	<h2>ASMSA</h2>
	<img src = "/static/Images/Senior.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of Daniel on his first day of Senior Year"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>Daniel applied to ASMSA to nurture his growing interest in Computer Science (and because his sister had applied, got in, and really enjoyed it). While there, he used it as a soft reset in his schooling career and tried out many school clubs and extra ciriculars. For senior years, he's trying to take a step back and focus more on having a few, specialized roles.</p>
	
	<h2>Books</h2>
	<p>Daniel read all of his favoirte books in middle school and tends to just reread them nowdays instead of actually finding new books to read. Generally, he likes most young adult novels, most dystopias, and quite a bit of the classics.</p>
	
	<img src = "/static/Images/HarryPotter.png" alt = "This is a picture of all seven of the original Harry Potter books by R.K. Rowling"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>There were two series defined Daniel's childhood reading. Harry Potter is the one his parents will expose him for obsessing over. JK Rowlings world of magic, wizards, and mysteries had an ten year old reading 300 pages in one evening. It also compelled a ten year old to (quite impulsively) spend $114 on a Griffendor robe and another $60 on Mad-Eye Moody's Wand.<br>Daniel's pretty confident that upon a reread, he probably won't like Harry Potter. Espicially after how critical he was reading the cursed child and realizing how loose the rules actually were. He also acknoledges the questionable comments of JK Rowling that make him hesitant of wanting to rebuy the books for his collection. At the moment, he relishes the enjoyment he found then and tries not to think about the series now.</p>

	<img src = "/static/Images/PercyJackson.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of the original five Percy Jackson books by Rcik Riordan"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>Percy Jackson and the Olypians is peak fiction and Daniel will not hear otherwise. Rick Riordan crafted an amazing world based in our own about gods, myths, and parental neglect that a ten year of Daniel just couldn't get enough of. Even better, Daniel started this series and finished it just after he had moved to Arkansas. When he went into his first class at his new school, the book that had managed to catch his eye was the Hero's of Olympus further dragging him into another few monts of pure, reading bliss. <br>Daniel rereads some part of the series once every two years and finds something new to enjoy about with every read.</p>

	<img src = "/static/Images/ArcOfAScythe.webp" alt = "This is a picture of the original Arc of a Scythe trilogy by Neil Shusterman"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>Daniel's favorite book series of all time is the Arc of a Scythe Series by Neil Shusterman. It's a perfect exploration of a dystopina world, corruption, human advancement, and what it means to be perfect. He first loved it for its combat and characters. When he next read it he loved it for its exploration of technology. When he most recently read it, he loved its exploration of what it means to be human and the inevitability of human corruption. <br>This series is what made Daniel want to be a computer scientist and is what inspires his idea of the future. he only rereads it when he feels called to.</p>

	<h2>Games</h2>
	<p>Daniel's an odd "gamer" because he never has a steady income to buy games as they come out. Whenever he gets a third party game, he normally gets it for Christmas and his birthday. This means whenever he wants to get a good game, he feels the need to either researrch evertying about it if its first party meaning he won't really go into it blind or buy a cheaper game. This has led him to fall of a lot of first party games in favor of more, cheaper indie games.</p>

	<img src = "/static/Images/Terarria.png" alt = "This is one of Daniel's Terraria houses and characters of the meele class"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>One Daniel's two favorite games of all time is Terraria. He spends a stupid amount of time on the grind in that game and never seems to grow tired of it. His favorite parts of the game are late prehardmode and early hardmode becuase then the Terrian feels their powerful but still weak against the world. The Terarria grind comes in batches where if he isn't into  it, he's into his other favorite game.<br>In game, his favorite class is mage becuase it highlights his motto in combat, "they can't kill you if they're dead." He goes into harder areas (like hell in prehardmode) early because he trust more in his abilities than the dangers of the world. He challenges Duke Fishron early for the flex internally and because there is nothing more empowering than challenging a late game boss early and wining based on pure skill. His only remaing long term goal in the game is to do a Hardcore run of the game to completion.</p>

	<img src = "/static/Images/Stardew.png" alt = "This is one of Daniel's Stardew Valley farms in its first winter"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>One of Daniel's two favorite games of all time is Stardew Valley. He loves the grind and optimization of planning out how to farm more optimally. Spreadsheets should never come out when someone is playing a game but nothing bring Daniel omre satisfaction to planning everything he needs to do in a day a week in advnance. He currently plays with a few quality of life mods installed.<br>His remaining goal in this game it to preform a min-max run to his maximum skill level. This would require him to abandon his friendship goals and sell out to Jojamart which he normally feels to guilty to commit to.</p>

	<img src = "/static/Images/HollowKnight.jpg" alt = "This is one of the promotional images for Hollow Knight"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>Hollow Knight is another great game Daniel has played. Getting lost in Hollownest is an expirence Daniel treasures every time it happens. There isn't much Daniel can say about the game that hasn't been said before. Give us Silksong.</p>
	
	<img src = "/static/Images/Hades.jpg" alt = "This is the cover art for Hades on the Epic Games Store"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>Hades is a masterclass of a rougue like that Daniel falls into every few months. It always starts with the thought "maybe I'll do a run or two" and ends with a four hour session where Daniel is trying to string wins together. Its so mentally exaushing for him but incredibly satisfying.</p>
	
	<img src = "/static/Images/DeltaCharizard.png" alt = "This is a picture of Delta Charizard from the Game Pokemon Insurgence"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>The best Pokemon game that Daniel has played has been Pokemon Insurgence. The fan game could never serve as a mainline game but is incredibly satisfying and fun to play through. Much more so than some of the recent games. On a sidenote, Delta Charizard has to be one of the coolest Pokemon of all time and is just another sentiment to how cool Charizard is as a Pokemon.</p>
	
	<img src = "/static/Images/PokemonShowdown.png" alt = "This is a picture of the Chrome extension Showdex being used on Pokemon Showdown"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>If you count the games Daniel has played the most in the past few months, Pokemon Showdown! is Daniel's favorite game. He considers it more of a time waster akin to a mobile game. That doesn't stop him from opening the website whenever he has nothing else to do.</p>

	<h2>Personality</h2>
	<img src = "/static/Images/MeyersBriggsINFP.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of an INFP from the Meyers-Briggs personality quiz"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>Daniel's Meyers-Briggs personality type is INFP, the Mediator. In summary, that means Daniel is one of the most extroverted of the introverts and spends a lot of time in his head. He has been this personality type for about two years. Additional fun fact, his sister, Beatrice, has the same personality type.</p>

	<img src = "/static/Images/GallupLeadership.png" alt = "This are all possible leadership results for the Gallup Leadership assessment test"  height="400" class = "center">
	<p>According to the Gallup leadership styles test, Daniel is a leader by Input. The other categories in his top five are Restorative, Achiever, Learner, and Analytical. The all work together in an ecosystem where Daniel values information above everything and will stall on acting on things if he can get more information about a subject.</p>
